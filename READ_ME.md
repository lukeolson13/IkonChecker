This is a simple program to help you make reservations at Ski Resorts that are
part of the Ikon Pass. During COVID, many ski resorts are capacity constrained
and have put in place a resservation system for season pass holders. Weekends 
are booked out and when spots open from cancellations they are filled quickly.

This tool will repeatedly refresh the open days on the Ikon Pass website, and
make a reservation on your requested day when it becomes available.

This tool is built using selenium, and expects the google chrome driver, which 
can be found here: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

TO USE:
Run main.py and follow the prompts on the command line.
Searches can be saved to and loaded from a json file.
